# notty

`📓` A simple note app with accent on Markdown support and interactivity.

## Motivation

Ability to make quick notes is a pretty cool one to have. A place to store every bit of useful information is a neat thing to have too.

I suppose, those two are the reasons why I decided to develop the app that combines both of them with simplicity in mind. 

## Usage

 `🌍` Deployed and ready to use version is [available here](https://notty.azurewebsites.net)!
